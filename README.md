# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Pablo â€“ AI Engineer & Full-Stack Developer

I'm a software engineer specializing in **LLM-powered applications**, **automation workflows**, and **full-stack product development**. I help startups and growing teams turn their data and business logic into **intelligent, scalable tools** using GPT-4, LangChain, and self-hosted LLMs like LLaMA.

I build end-to-end systems that combine modern UI/UX, real-time data access, and AI to automate processes and improve decision-making â€” all with clean, reliable code and thoughtful architecture.
